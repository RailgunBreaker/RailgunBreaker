Hello! I'm a third-year student pursuing a dual degree between **Ritsumeikan University** and **Australian National University**, majoring in *Global Liberal Arts* and *Asia Pacific Affairs*. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of Japanese society, politics, and culture.

1. Institutional discrimination against foreign residents in Japan—including Japanese nationals raised abroad—and the development and implementation of multicultural coexistence policies.
    
2. The interaction between Japan’s animation industry (broadcasting and production) and the dynamics of Sino–Japanese relations.
    
3. Broader issues in contemporary Japanese politics and their implications for society.
